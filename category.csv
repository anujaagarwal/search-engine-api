"12","pcr","1","5","1","5-12","PCR ","PCR
Polymerase chain reaction or PCR is a technique developed by American biochemist Kary Mullis. This technique can amplify (make multiple copies of) a particular sequence of interest in a DNA. The first step in the process is the denaturation of the double-stranded DNA at a temperature of 94 to 96 degree Celsius. This is followed by annealing or joining of the specifically designed primer at the target site and then the action of polymerase leading to its elongation by the addition of the nucleotides from the nucleotide mixture added. The denaturation takes about 30 secs, the annealing about 20 to 40 secs and the elongation takes several minutes depending upon the number of cycles set in the PCR machine. 2n copies of DNA are made where n is the number of cycles. The annealing temperature usually varies between 50 to 65 degree Celsius whereas the elongation temperature on the average is 72 degree Celsius 
Requirement: PCR machine, the sample DNA template, a polymerase enzyme to initiate the polymerization of new strands (usually the heat resistant Taq polymerase is used), the designed forward and reverse primers that will bind to the sense and antisense strands of the sample DNA template, the deoxynucleoside triphosphates or dNTPs mixture which will provide the nucleotides for elongation - they act as the building blocks of the new strand, and the buffer solution to maintain the pH are the key requirements. PCR tubes are different and smaller from the regular Eppendorf tubes. The PCR reagents are heat sensitive and therefore stored in ice. PCR Kits are also available with everything readymade and quick to use.
Types: In addition to the conventional PCR, a gradient PCR with a range of variation in annealing temperature can also be used. It is Ideal when samples are unknown. A digital PCR where the concentration of the targeted DNA is measured by diluting the sample and then running multiple PCR such that some don’t receive a single copy of the target DNA, this is used to negatively determine the concentration.
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) which uses fluorescent dyes like Sybr Green to measure the quantity of amplified product in real time.
Applications
PCR has its application in confirming the presence of a gene. In DNA cloning and DNA fingerprinting experiments or quantitatively to estimate the level of gene expression amongst others.

A typical desiccator is made of heavy glass (usually rugged soda lime glass) and has two compartments in it. The lower one has a desiccant, which withdraws the moisture out of the air and keeps the desiccator dry. These desiccants could be anhydrous sodium chloride pellets or silica gel. The upper compartment keeps the substance which needs to be protected. A lid at the top closes the desiccator. Some enclosures use an additional vacuum stopcock for further evacuation of air. These are called vacuum desiccator. A manual of specifications with regards to handling and maintenance comes along.
Things to take care of
• Desiccators should be tested before using
• It may take some time after adding the desiccants for the adsorption of moisture
• A vacuum grease or petroleum jelly is used on the lid to ensure air-tight sealing
• A highly hygroscopic substance may not be suited for this type of desiccator since the lid open time to time
• Not suitable for large storage. A cabinet desiccator must be used for large storage.
• A dehumidifier zone may be set up around the desiccator for maximum efficiency","product/category.jpg","1","0","1","Buy online Laboratory desiccators in India | Biomall","laboratory desiccators,price,biomall,india","Buy Laboratory desiccators online in India.

The principle of working is same as in the one used in a kitchen, its usage is in chemistry and biology lab. A stir bar (or ‘beads’ or 'flea') is immersed into the liquid and the device generates a magnetic field which causes the bar to rotate and thereby generating a vortex stirring the liquid. The temperature of the hot plate and the frequency of rotation (rpm) can easily be adjusted manually. The device is available in multiple dimensions.  The manufacturer/supplier provides an operation manual with all specifications details. Calibration and application details can be seen in the manual.
Features
• Digital display.
• Rotation frequency ranges from 100 to 1000 rpm.
• Corrosion resistant plate.
• Bright white colored plate to enhance solution visibility.
• Simple design with easy handling and cleaning.

Cautions
• Stir bars are available in various shapes and lengths. Pick the one that suits the size of the vessel containing liquid.

Micropipettes are one of the most widely used equipment for scientific research and experimentation. Their function is to dispense and/or transfer very small volumes of liquid. By definition, the principle remains the same as that of any other pipette, however, the measure of volume can range from 0.1 to 5000 units of volume. It has both a volume adjuster and a volume indicator. ISO certified Biosystems manufactures durable, autoclavable (lower part) and easy to handle micropipettes. Micropipettes require micropipette tips or microtips (which are autoclavable as well) which are available in various size and color (for easy identification) depending upon the volume. A plastic shaft at the lower end of the pipette is where the tip is to be attached and ejected after it is used by pressing the tip ejector. Both the index finger as well as the thumb can be used to dispense the liquid by pressing the plunger. One can choose from Micropipette sizes, brand, cost, and type of color code. An online package may offer advantages like buying a micropipette holder, stand and a guide to explain its mechanism and quality control all along.
Eliminating error
Since micropipette use a very small volume of liquid their mishandling can be a cause of error in the Lab
• To eliminate contamination it is vital that the tips are sterile and have not come in contact with the user or any object while micropipetting
• Turning the volume indicator beyond or below the volume range might lead to inaccurate volumes been withdrawn or the breakage of the volume indicator
• While operating, The plunger is to be released slowly while withdrawing the liquid; an abrupt release might lead to the sucking in of the liquid inside the pipette giving inaccurate results
• Micropipettes should not be dipped below1-3 mm into the liquid containing Eppendorf (or another object) while withdrawing as this may lead to the adherence of liquid at the tip whereas dipping above this range it may lead to the sucking in of air. Either way, it will produce an error
• Pipettes can be calibrated using the gravimetric or the colorimetric method, protocols of which can be found in the guide attached. Calibration is a good way for micropipette maintenance and repair.

These strong magnet bars are coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or a suitable glass material which is chemically inert, hydrophobic and heat and corrosion resistant. They function as vital accessories to the hot plate. They can easily be retrieved/removed from the flask after their usage. These bars of various sizes ranging from very small to large and different types of shape are available in kits, sets, offered by different brands. 
Types
• The standard bar is round and smooth. A pivot ring at the center acts as the point of rotation. This reduces friction and increases the stirring efficiency.
• A triangular or polygonal shape generates stronger vortex and more turbulence than cylindrical or round shape bars
• Octagonal or egg-shaped bar generates even stronger vortex and turbulence and is more suited for higher rpms. Oval and egg shaped bars are ideal for flasks with a round or curved bottom.","product/category.jpg","4","1","0","Buy Online Laboratory Magnetic Stirrer and Bars, India | Biomall","magnetic stirrer,laboratory stirrer,magnetic bars,biomall,India","Buy online laboratory magnetic stirrer and bars in India at Biomall.in.

"123","cloning","1","5","1","5-123","Cloning","Cloning
It is a molecular biology technique wherein a selected sequence of DNA is cloned into multiple copies in a host organism (usually bacteria).  A vector is required to introduce the DNA sequence of interest into the host. This vector in most cases is a plasmid (which is a non-chromosomal DNA which can replicate on its own). A modified plasmid DNA has an origin of replication which allows the plasmid to replicate using the host’s enzymes and an antibiotic resistance sequence which grants antibiotic resistance to the host organism. The Plasmids are treated with restriction enzymes (or restriction endonuclease) which cleave the plasmid DNA at a specific region called as the restriction sites (EcoRI, BamHI or HindIII are some restriction enzymes). This cleavage in most cases leads to the production of single-stranded sticky ends also called as cohesive ends or overhangs which can anneal with the foreign DNA which has also been cut with the same enzyme. This annealing process is also referred to as ligation/hybridization because it occurs with the action of DNA ligase. The plasmid is now known as a recombinant plasmid
The bacterial cells (E. coli) which have been treated with calcium chloride to make them more permeable to DNA molecules are added to the recombinant plasmid mixture. By the process known as transformation (uptake of a foreign/exogenous genetic material from the surrounding) some amongst many bacterial cells take up the recombinant plasmid.
These bacterial cells are poured onto the nutrient agar containing an antibiotic (ampicillin or neomycin). After incubation, this will result in the growth of only those cells which have taken the antibiotic resistance gene (these also happen to be the successfully transformed cells)
The plasmid replication is independent of the host’s replication. However when host cells divide each of the daughter cells receives copies of plasmids. This results in the production of large copies of the recombinant plasmid.
Kits are available for plasmid preparation, ligation, and plasmid purification or for all of the cloning procedures combined in one.

Nucleic acid purification
DNA purification and extraction
Swiss Biologist Friedrich Miescher was the first person to isolate a DNA. The process refers to both extraction and purification of DNA from the given sample. The sample can be blood, swab, plant cells (like from a leaf), fruit, bacteria etc. A general protocol involves homogenization of cells using a physical method like the use of mortar and pestle. This may be followed by a series of chemical treatment with detergents like sodium laurel sulfate which pulls apart fats and proteins or using Chloroform followed by centrifugation where chloroform with unwanted cellular components settled down. 
A high temperature may be maintained to promote cell lysis. A buffer like tris-HCl or EDTA to maintain pH is used throughout.
Ethanol or isopropanol is then used to precipitate out the DNA.
Purification may involve many steps like the use of proteinase or phenol-chloroform extraction to eliminate protein impurities or RNAse to remove RNA
Kits for extraction and purification of DNA from depending on the source are available.

Industries and laboratories use chemicals which are highly flammable and/or combustible. Improper handling/ Storing of these can lead to explosion, fire or generation of toxic gasses. The World Health Organization (WHO) in its Laboratory Biosafety manual and the Indian National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) recommends the use of fire safety measures.  A fire safety cabinet is a specially designed cabinet for storing Flammable liquids. Flammable liquids are to be kept in an environment which will not allow these liquids reach its Flash Point and cause auto ignition, and resist the chemical property of the solvents to become a rich flammable mixture. These environments are normally attained by making a strong Brick wall, with Proper ventilation for air exchange, and automatic door closure during the fire, a centralized storage facility.
Fire safety cabinet is a prototype of the Centralized storage facility to avoid logistical accidents while transporting the flammable liquids from the central storage to their working place, the cabinets replicate the same property to resist fire by self-door closing mechanism, proper ventilation through exhaust ports for proper air exchange. While storing flammable liquids in Fire resistance cabinets one should measure the distance from the nearest fire brigade to extinguish an ongoing fire, the nearest exit for the working people to evacuate, the damage which can cause to the nearest building due to the fire. Therefore according to EN Standard 14470, Fire resistance cabinets should be able to resist fire for minimum 30 minutes and maximum 90 minutes. These cabinets are made up of multiple layers of self-insulating material covered with stainless steel. All Industry working with Flammable liquid store their flammable solvents in these Fire-resistant cabinets.

Much like the hoods in homes and kitchens, the machine generates air flow away from the user (negative air pressure) thereby taking with it the fumes/particles of the chemicals and filtering and/or treating it before release. This, therefore, prevents the facility and the user from the hazardous fumes and particle. The face velocity is generally between 60 to 100 fpm. It also prevents the entry of any flying debris or another airborne particle into the chemical itself. Fume hoods provide spacious working area and various equipment like the hot plate, overhead stirrer and weighing balance etc. can be used inside of it. The hood comes in various design and dimensions and has an exhaust fan and a duct attached, a low and high flow beeping alarms and in some cases, a blower is used instead of the duct.  The installation of the blower is easy the noise level is low. Hoods have enough lighting and are easy to operate and handle.  A detailed manual with technical specifications, occupancy user guidelines, and information pertaining to monitoring, repair and maintenance details come along. Ideal for chemistry and Biology labs.
